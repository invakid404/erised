Title: What is a widget?
---

From a very high-level view, Erised is simply a glorified widget loader. But what even is a widget?

A widget is a plugin for Erised, which encapsulates some functionality and essentially displays something on the screen. For example, a plugin could be a clock, a calendar, a weather report, a news feed, etc. Erised itself doesn't implement any of the things that show up on the smart mirror. All of those are plugins - separate from the core project.
