Title: Not-so-minimal example
---

In the previous section, we dissected a barebones example of a widget. It works, but is not very practical. For a more complete example, which invokes functions from the core application, makes use of more complicated QWidget structures, fetches external APIs and parses JSON data, stores a state, has resources, etc., take a look at the [weather widget](https://github.com/invakid404/erised/tree/main/weather-widget).
