Erised is designed for deployment on ARM-based computers, such as the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). Official Docker images for ARM are automatically built for every release and can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/invakid404/erised).

For the rest of this page, we'll assume you're running a Debian-based operating system, e.g. Raspbian.
