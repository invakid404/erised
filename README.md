=========================
### [NOIT 2020/2021, Project 208](https://edusoft.fmi.uni-sofia.bg)

![Build status](https://github.com/invakid404/erised/actions/workflows/commit.yml/badge.svg)

Erised is a modular smart mirror solution inspired by Sci-Fi culture.

It is an intelligent personal assistant, modeled for maximal balance between convenience, usability, security, and has a beautiful, futuristic look.

⚠️ **This project is under heavy development**: It is not full and production-ready yet.

## Installation

The officially supported way of deploying Erised is with *Docker*:
```sh
echo "WIP"
```

## Coding conventions

Erised uses [**clang-format**](https://github.com/invakid404/erised/blob/main/.clang-format) for formatting C++ code and a slight modification of the Google C++ code style. For the web panel (TypeScript/HTML/CSS/...), the [**prettier**](https://github.com/invakid404/erised/blob/main/web-panel/.prettierrc) formatter is being used.

In terms of commit namings, Erised roughly follows [Angular's commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) specification.

## Documentation

Please see the [Erised wiki](https://www.erised.tk/docs) for documentation.
